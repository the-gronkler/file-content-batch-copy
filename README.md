# file-content-batch-copy

(Windows) Add a context menu command to directories, which will copy the content of all files in this directory to clipboard ;) \
Copies the content of text files, regardless of extension

Usage:
1. Download CombineTextFiles.ps1 - this is the script, and place it in "C:\Scripts\" folder
2. Download CombineTextFiles.reg and run it - this is the registry entry, will add a command to run the script to the context menu for directories. It will warn you not to run the file if you do not trust the source, and ask if you want to continue: Press Yes.
4. Done :)
